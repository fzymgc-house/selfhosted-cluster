# Windmill Migration Progress

Migration from Argo Events + Argo Workflows to Windmill for GitOps automation.

**Issue Tracker**: [GitHub Issues #127-#150](https://github.com/fzymgc-house/selfhosted-cluster/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Awindmill-migration)

## Overview

Migrating Terraform GitOps workflows from Argo Events/Workflows to Windmill with:
- GitHub webhooks directly to Windmill
- Flows defined as code in repository
- GitHub Actions with wmill sync for deployment
- Self-hosted GitHub Actions runner (actions-runner-controller)
- Storj S3 for workflow storage
- Windmill approval steps with Discord notifications
- Concurrency control for Terraform applies

## Migration Phases

### Phase 0: Disable Argo Events and Workflows ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: Completed 2025-12-07

**Issue**: #127

**Completed Tasks**:
- ✅ Disabled automated syncing in ArgoCD applications
  - Modified `argocd/cluster-app/templates/argo-events.yaml`
  - Modified `argocd/cluster-app/templates/argo-workflows.yaml`
- ✅ Merged PR #151 to main branch
- ✅ Synced cluster-app to apply changes
- ✅ Scaled all Argo Events deployments to 0 replicas
- ✅ Scaled all Argo Workflows deployments to 0 replicas

**Verification**:
```bash
# All deployments scaled to zero
kubectl --context fzymgc-house get deployment -n argo-events
kubectl --context fzymgc-house get deployment -n argo-workflows

# No workflow pods running
kubectl --context fzymgc-house get pods -n argo-workflows
```

**Impact**: GitHub webhooks will no longer trigger Terraform workflows. Manual Terraform operations required until Windmill flows are operational.

## Current State

### Active Components
- ✅ Windmill (deployed, 3 worker groups)
- ✅ PostgreSQL (Windmill database)
- ✅ Redis (Windmill cache)

### Disabled Components
- ❌ Argo Events (scaled to 0)
- ❌ Argo Workflows (scaled to 0)
- ⚠️ EventBus (still running, will remove in Phase 5)

### Affected Terraform Modules

## Rollback Plan

Not applicable - per user decision, Argo Events and Workflows are being removed regardless of Windmill migration success.
